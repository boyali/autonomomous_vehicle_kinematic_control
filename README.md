This repository contains two basic tutorials for designing a kinematic controller for autonomous vehicles. In the
 first notebook, we show a simple implementation for computation of the feedback gains for the gain scheduling. 
 
 The second notebook contains methods on how to compute a reference point on the given reference path and path
  following lateral and yaw deviation errors which are used for error dynamics and error feedback.
